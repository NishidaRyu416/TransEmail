# This is the repository of what I made during an Ideathon!

## What is this?
This web application allows users to send emails almost automatically in a super effective and best way properly depensing on the purpoeses and who to send by suggesting them templates!
## Technical Info
This application is made with Ruby on Rails with HTML&CSS.
## Warning!
As this application is just a prototype you may be unable to use this in production soon.
Moreover, this application has to have some features to be a product. So I'd like to clarify below.

## Todo
- Authenication
    Login or Registering
- Use email engine other than gmail API
    As gmail's API should be for indiviusals, you ought to use other engines especially for businesses like mailgun!
## Contributors wanted!
Finally, as I want to focus on my current business, I may no longer continue to develop this application.
So if you were interested in this project, please let me know!
